# CS591-Project
Tommy Suen CS591 Project

This is an travel app that includes some of the finest features including the Yelp API, Eventful API, and Ticketmaster API. The goal of this app is be an all-inclusive app and instead of going to multiple sites and researching for different restaurants, hotels and looking for things to do, this app will do it for you. It will allow the user to sign up and search for a desired travel location and their preferred activity they want to do and the app will return the top three hotels, restaurants, and user's selected activity based on people's reviews.

----Code Navigation----
Front is the angular code generated by Angular. Inside will have all the components inside Yelp-Component and inside will have master and nav folders. Master will be the overall html and project, while Nav is the simple header with the sign in button.

Public was created after ng build and will call everything (back-end and angular) by using npm start.
